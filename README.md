# What's My District (Redux)

## What is this?

[What's My District?](http://www.whatsmydistrict.org) started off as a National
Day of Civic Hacking project. It essentially allows anyone in Lexington, KY to
input their address and find out all the differenct districts they are in,
including schools, council districts, magistrate districts, and etc.


This is the 3rd evolution using Lexington's new open data APIs and MapboxGL.
